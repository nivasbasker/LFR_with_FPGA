# LFR_with_FPGA

This repo contains source code for A LFR with FPGA, in Verilog language, along with functionalities like Color detection, PWM, UART message transmission and Dijkstra's algorithm for autonomous path planning

<b>Theme Description:</b> In this theme, we build the SM Bot for deployment on an arena that abstracts an agriculture field. The brain of the robot is powered by an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) that controls its sensors, actuators and pick-place mechanism. Challenges and learnings in this theme include building a Soil Monitoring Bot from scratch using an FPGA. This robot traverses the arena, senses the environment and picks and places necessary supplies from the supply unit to the field. It uses wired and wireless communication. We help teams build a sophisticated architecture using Verilog HDL to unveil the
powerful parallel processing capabilities of FPGAs.

<b>Theme Learning</b>: FPGA architecture, FPGA programming using Verilog HDL, Wireless communication concepts, building a bot using a real FPGA development board.
